What does this script do? :

- parse video from youtube. Going through the words from the list,
and finally filters by the number of views and the number of subscribers
from the channel where the video was taken from.
- writes all matching data to a .csv file.

How to prepare? :
Unfortunately this script work only with proxy (it must be proxy with USA IP)
So you should buy proxy, and write auth data in ".env" file.
Example:
    PROXY_ADDRESS = "IP_ADDRESS:PORT"
    PROXY_LOGIN = "YOUR_LOGIN"
    PROXY_PASS = "YOUR_PASSWORD"

Other setting info you can find in "config.py" file.
Also you could set up your own setting there.
